# Guild

So my purposal is that we form a political/media/union guild.

Our services would include:
  Facilitation of progressive partisan political unity.
  Providing a forum for discourse, the establishment of consensus between progressive pundits and aspiring public figures and then a system of accountability towards those ends. 
  Forming a unified front to lobby governments to protect against yellow journalism, workers rights and media/poltical mobility
  
While difficult I believe focusing on cross international narratives will help support media/political/union efforts to contextualize themselves and we could facilitate this international engagement as a service. 

Offer economy of scale benefits and economic security to small time media figures, pundits and unions.


Key groups to form partnerships with:
Socialist International
Industrial Workers of the World
Novara media
Jacobin
International Labor Communications Association
CALM/acps
International Longshore and Warehouse Union
National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers

We would need to adhere to a practice of strict egalitarianism and be brutally strict in terms of membership and affiliation, A coalition but one brutally loyal to good principle and accountable to it.
